This application has a Node.js / Express.js backend and a React.js frontend. It does not display actual weather. The point of this application is to demonstrate the unit tests one can write for the React.js components. I wrote for the Women Who Code ATX React.js meetup, to illustrate unit testing concepts.

It is deployed here:
